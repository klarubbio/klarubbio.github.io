  abstract={Behavior-based authentication methods are actively being developed for XR. In particular, gaze-based methods promise continuous au-thentication of remote users. However, gaze behavior depends on the task being performed. Identification rate is typically highest when comparing data from the same task. In this study, we compared authentication performance using VR gaze data during random dot viewing, 360-degree image viewing, and a nuclear training simu-lation. We found that within-task authentication performed best for image viewing (72%). The implication for practitioners is to integrate image viewing into a VR workflow to collect gaze data that is viable for authentication.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={Personal space bubbles are implemented in virtual environments to protect users from physical harassment. When activated, an impermeable boundary encloses the user completely and complicates collaborative tasks, such as passing objects or performing social gestures. When personal space protection is not balanced with functionality, the personal space bubble becomes a gilded cage. In this paper, we raise the possibility of alternate designs for personal space bubbles and test their impact on task performance within a workplace training context. Our early findings suggest that alternate bubble designs have the potential to balance safety and performance metrics such as task completion.},
