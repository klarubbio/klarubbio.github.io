I'm a Ph.D. student at Brown University studying computer science. My research focuses on leveraging user-generated data to enhance users' productivity and well-being in ways that are sensitive to privacy and other relevant concerns. I am particularly interested in the uses of behavioral data collected by [extended reality](https://klarubbio.github.io/projects/2_project/) and [human-ai](TODO: add linky to new project) interfaces.


Previously, I did my undergrad at the University of Florida. In my free time, I can usually be found baking a sweet treat, watching Gators football/gymnastics, hiking, going to concerts, or hiding from the cold at hot yoga.
