I am a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student advised by Dr. Diana Freed at Brown University. My primary research interest is sociotechnical systems within the context of at-risk populations. 


Technologies make assumptions about behavior, but I'm interested in understanding what happens when those assumptions are wrong, especially for at-risk users. I am particularly interested in evaluating and improving emerging technologies, like extended reality and artificial intelligence.


Previously, I earned a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Florida. I did fun research projects on applications of eye tracking, interpersonal interactions in virtual reality, and spatial cognition in virtual reality.
