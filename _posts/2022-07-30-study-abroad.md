This Summer, I spent 6 weeks studying in Paris, France as a part of the <a href="https://ufabroad.internationalcenter.ufl.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&id=11840">UF in Paris - Culture in Context program.</a> The experience connected me with language learning resources, numerous cultural experiences, and incredible memories. It was my first time outside of the country, which, while daunting, provided me with tremendous opportunities for growth.

   Some of the most important cultural experiences: food and art. We spent almost every day at a new museum, and I started almost everyday with pain au chocolat.

While my studies are largely technical, I've enjoyed language learning as a hobby for years. I found myself constantly explaining myself to family, friends, and myself, trying to justify why I was interested in studying something seemingly unrelated to my career goals. In reality, I wanted to study this simply because I enjoyed it. 

Aside from developping personally, I can see language learning opening doors for me professionally as well. Though I haven't had the chance to yet, I would like to explore language learning technologies as a possible route to connect my passion of HCI with this experience. Especially with the rise of conversational agents, LLM's could enable contextual learning through realistic interactions.

When I wasn't in class, I did my best to see France outside of the city. I visited St. Malo, where I enjoyed the best crêpes of my life with a beautiful view of the beach (just like Florida haha). In Deauville, I experienced the coldest beach day ever with some random but delicious Italian food. In Reims, we toured the beautiful Reims Cathedral, which hosted the crownings of numerous French monarchs. I never felt more grateful for AP European History in high school. In Rennes, it felt like stepping into a storybook. I enjoyed a solo day trip to Giverny, where I visited Claude Monet's home and grave.

I also travelled outside of France. I took a weekend trip to Luxembourg, where the nice scenery almost makes up for the price of water. After my program, I visited a friend Osnabrück, Germany and took a day trip Münster. Biking around the cities made for a memorable experience.
