The Diabetes VR team collaborates with an endocrinology team at Shands to create an educational game in virtual reality for pediatric diabetes patients. The goal is to help patients learn about subjects like portioning, carb counting, and more in an engaging and immersive way which leverages the unique capabilities of virtual environments. We combine programming skills with art and game design using technologies including Unity with C# scripting and Blender.

As the captain of this team, I guide a group of undergraduates through implementing a VR game and learning Unity along the way by organizing sprint cycles. This work is a part of the student-led nonprofit organization at the University of Florida called <a href="https://www.ufdreamteameng.org/">Dream Team Engineering</a>, whose mission is to collaborate with UF Health hospitals and the surrounding Gainesville community to develop technologies that enhance patient and family experiences, particularly for pediatric patients. I also engage in leadership through this organization as the Executive Director of Membership and previously the Director of Recruitment. These roles enable me to help other undergraduates connect with meaningful applications of their technical skills to make a positive impact in the community.
